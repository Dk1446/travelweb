    <div class="partone">
        <p>It’s 3:30 a.m. when I disembark the ferry in a trance
            after a 10-hour sail from Athens. The air is soft
            and warm in Amorgos, a pristine island off the coast
            of Greece. Wooden fishing boats rock against their
            moors, lit villages dot the high hills, and a sweet
            scent of sage laces the morning air. Once the day
            starts, it’s on to the reason I came here: to look
            for Sister Irini.<br>
            Amorgos's many monasteries, among the oldest in the world, draw
            tourists by the thousands, mostly from France, Italy, and Greece,
            and its unparalleled beauty—rough and raw with azure blue seas and
            sky—cause one to slow down and linger. One tourist has lingered so
            long she is now a practicing nun.
            Seven years ago, Sister Irini began transforming a long-abandoned
            monastery into an oasis. Visitors come throughout the year to walk
            her bountiful garden lined with Byzantine frescos, to hear her story,
            and to purchase her magnificent paintings of religious icons.
            She first came to the island as a young mother and wife 35 years ago; after her husband passed, she chose a
            new path. Her name is Sister Irini, now, and she remains Amorgos’s only nun.
            Cloaked in a black habit, she welcomes me on a tour of her home,
            expressing her love for faith, her garden, and life as a nun. Later,
            when I ask about her prior name and life, she withholds.
            “Last names don’t exist as a nun.” Sister Irini takes a long pause.
            “I had to divorce myself from my brothers and sisters. I waited until
            my children were independent.”

    <p>Sister Irini moved to Amorgos and took her vows as a Greek Orthodox nun in 2011. She spends her days gardening,
        painting, and praying, but always welcomes visitors to her monastery, Agios Georgios Valsamitis (or St. George
        Valsamitis). <br>
        “It was empty and alone, and I had to work hard to make it paradise,” she says. “It really is paradise!”
        <br>
        Valsamitis appears Eden-like after an exhilarating ride up dusty roads, trying to avoid unruly, wandering
        goats. Its lush shade is a gift in the blistering afternoon sun and the cool landscape: a small miracle. The
        monastery sits upon an ancient well, previously a water oracle where 17th-century water readers foretold
        believers’ futures through the blessings of St. George. The Church is opposed to such notions, so the bishop
        had the well cemented shut in 1967.

    <p>Still, the 30 fruit trees that Sister Irini lovingly planted are clearly drinking from the spring. As I stroll
        under the protective boughs of oranges, lemons, apricots, peaches, and olives, cats lounge amid beds of
        flowers, stretching and yawning without a care in the world.
        <br>
        “The cats were sick,” says Sister Irini, “but I brought in doctors and now they’re happy.”

    <h2>Life on Amorgos</h2>

    <p>
        It’s not difficult to see what could have first attracted her to a permanent life on Amorgos: It’s a respite
        from the outer world. Imagine leaving everything behind for a place where the sun-lit sea of diamonds shines by
        day and sailboats clink beneath a starlit sky at night. <br>
